# #1: Count my emoji

Clone the following repo:

[https://github.com/gforce-sh/react-exercise](https://github.com/gforce-sh/react-exercise)

We are going to work on the `main` branch (a sample react app is setup on the `react-app-template` branch).

In this lab, we will learn how to update and reset a simple counter by 1.

> Further practice:

> 1. Can we store a history of numbers displayed, with the list shown beneath the reset button?
> 2. Can we use this template to create a simple calculator? The calculator should support basic addition, subtraction,
