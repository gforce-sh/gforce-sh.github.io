# JSX

#### What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It allows us to write HTML-like syntax that transpiles to Javascript objects.

#### How do we transpile JSX to Javascript code and HTML?

✨Babel - `https://babeljs.io/docs/` ✨

#### Time example

We can re-write our application using CSS and JSX:

```
https://codepen.io/grvshrm/pen/KKGYGqE
```

<iframe
  src="https://codepen.io/grvshrm/embed/KKGYGqE"
  style={{ width: "100%", height: "400px" }}
></iframe>

From our example, the following is JSX:

```
const Component = () => {
  const currentTime = new Date();
  
  return (
    <div id="container">
      <h1>Hello world!</h1>

      <p className="text">You opened this page on {currentTime.toLocaleString()}</p>
      <p className="shaded">What are the odds of it being exactly {currentTime.toLocaleTimeString()}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Component />,  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

#### How is transpilation different from compilation?

- Compilation: Source code converted to another language that has a marked _lower_ level of abstraction.
- Transpilation: Source code converted to source code again, with a _similar_ level of abstraction.

#### How is this approach better?

1. This approach is not imperative, but *declarative*. We're no longer looking for HTML nodes to manipulate. Through JSX, we _declare_ what the structure of the HTML should be, and React does the rest.
2. Writing Javascript together with HTML makes our code concise.
3. We only need 1 line of HTML - the "root" `div`.
4. Unit testing is possible now, I just need to consider the JSX element `Component`.
5. Creating `Component` also means that we can modularise our code.
6. All this means that it is easier to read and extend our code, which means its easier to scale our application.
