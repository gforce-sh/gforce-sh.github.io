# HTML, CSS and JS

### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

HTML defines the structure of a webpage using a sequence of user-written tags. Every tag has an opening and closing syntax.

```
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
</head>

<body>
  <div id="container">
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p class="text">You opened this page on</p>
  </div>
</body>
```

<Image
  src={require('./assets/html.png').default}
  style={{ marginBottom: 50 }}
  size="medium"
  bordered
/>

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

#### Adding styles to the content

```
#container {
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 30px;
  height: 100%;
  font-size: 20px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-radius: 5px;
  width: fit-content;
}

h1 {
  color: maroon;
}

.text {
  margin: 20px 0;
  color: blue;
}

.shaded {
  font-size: 16px;
  color: darkBlue;
  background: #e7e7e7;
  padding: 5px;
}
```

<Image

  style={{ marginBottom: 50 }}
  size="medium"
  bordered
/>

### Javascript

#### Adding logic using vanilla JS

We want to:

- Find out what the current time is
- Add the current time to the page content

```
// 1. Find the present time
const currentTime = new Date();

// 2. Find element in DOM and change its text content
var paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll("p");
var timeParagraph = paragraphs[0];
timeParagraph.textContent =
  timeParagraph.textContent + " " + currentTime.toLocaleString();

// 3. (Optional) add a new paragraph
var p = document.createElement("p");
p.textContent = `What are the odds of it being exactly ${currentTime.toLocaleTimeString()}!`;
p.className = "shaded";

var container = document.getElementById("container");
container.appendChild(p);
```

### What are the issues here?

1. This is an _imperative_ approach to writing software. Imperative programming is a paradigm where we explicitly state how the program should achieve the desired result. Our approach is imerative as our Javascript code is tightly coupled to the HTML elements, and we have to explicitly define which unique HTML element we want to change.
2. This coupling results in unintended changes that break our application. For example, if we add a new HTML tag to the top of the page, our current webpage would break, because `timeParagraph` would no longer be the `0th` element in the `paragraphs` array.
3. How do we unit test this? Unit testing is breaking down the functionality of our application into singular units, and writing code that individually tests if these units work as expected.
4. How can we modularise a unit bit of functionality? There will be a lot of code replication as the application grows bigger.
5. Imperative implementations are verbose because DOM manipulations are a rather long-drawn process.
