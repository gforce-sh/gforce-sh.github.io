# Preface

### About

This e-book contains knowledge of modern application development and healthy
software engineering principles that I have learned in my time as a
technologist in the banking industry and at university. The content is
written with an emphasis to help readers pick up these skills for themselves.
I have included several exercises to help reinforce concepts. I like to
start small, iterate quickly and scale big, and the content of this book may
reflect this approach.

So far, this book contains:

1. a course on frontend development using React, a
   modern, flexible and time-tested framework,
2. a course on component-driven development, an effective technique to develop
   and manage expansive applications,
3. my notes on clean-coding principles.

This content is continually updated, and more is on the way. To reach
out to me directly, please head to the last chapter - ![Reach out](./ReachOut.
